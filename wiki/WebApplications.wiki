Go to the source directory where `runcgi.py` and `runwsgi.py` are located. 

If you have Python >= 2.5 then execute `runwsgi.py` and go to http://localhost:8000/?. Otherwise, execute `runcgi.py` and go to http://localhost:8000/cgi-bin/weather.py?

The script operates on the QUERY_STRING variable so anything after the `?` should be a station identifier.
